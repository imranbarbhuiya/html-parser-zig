# HTML Parser

This is a simple HTML parser that can parse HTML files and extract information such as tags, attributes, and comments. Written from scratch in zig. This is my first time trying zig, so the code won't be the best. But I'm open to suggestions and improvements.

I believe in learning by doing, so I first learned go by writing a simple language named [ran](https://github.com/imranbarbhuiya/ran/). Which taught me a lot about lexer, tokenizer, parser, interpreter, and compiler. So I used some of that tokenizer and parser logic here to build this simple HTML parser.
